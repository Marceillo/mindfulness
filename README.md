# Mindfulness

## Site Overview <a name="site-overview"></a>

The site is about mindfulness, the ability of human beings to be fully present and aware of time and space around them. The site is small and straight to the point with a minimalistic feel. 




## Previous Repository <a name="minfulness01"></a>

One day into developing the site on Github the repository was not updating or synchronising with Gitpod.
After a couple of hours of trial and error, I had to delete the repository and start over. Luckily I made a copy of the basic code and was able not to lose more time in the process.

## Planning stage <a name="planning-stage"></a>

### Site Aims: <a name="site-aims"></a>

- The goal of this site was to provide some information about mindfulness.
- I wanted it to be minimalistic with a very simple but nice colour template.
- The minimalistic approach is always good leaving room for more features at a later stage.


### Target Audiences: <a name="target-audience"></a>

- Users looking to improve their quality of life.
- Users who are looking within themselves.
- User who wants to live life to the best of their ability.

## Planning stage - How I will achieve this: <a name="how-i-will-achieve-this"></a>

- The home page provides the user with clear information on what mindfulness is about.
- The techniques page provides short meditation information and ways of incorporating mindfulness in your life.
- There is a contact page form that gives access to them to write what questions or information they need.
- The footer provides the user with contact details for them to get in touch via social media.
- The footer provides the user with social links so they can access more information on mindfulness.
- The footer also has no names but icons keeping true to the minimalistic view.

### Wireframes: <a name="wireframes"></a>

I created wireframes for this project. Below are links to my site's mobile and desktop versions.

## Color Scheme: <a name="color-scheme"></a>

- I wanted colours  that match the hero's image as this would create a nice viewing experience.

## Elements used on all pages: <a name="elements-used-on-all-pages"></a>

## Header Element <a name="header-element"></a>

The header element is stuck to the top of the page, there were difficulties when it came to different screen sizes but those bugs were resolved.

### Navigation: <a name="navigation"></a>

##### Navigation for screen sizes larger than 786px:

![navigation](assets/gallery/navigation-bar.png) 

##### Navigation for screen sizes smaller than 786px:

![navigation small](assets/gallery/mobile-nav-bar.png)

- The navigation appears on all pages.
- It contains links to home, techniques, contact 
- When the user is on a specific page, the link corresponding to their page will have the classes "active".

## Footer Element <a name="footer-element"></a>

The footer element is at the very bottom of every page and has the social media icons sources from awsemfonts.

### Socials: <a name="socials"></a>

![socials](assets/gallery/larger-screen-footer.png)

- There are four links in the footer to take the user to different media platforms.
- The platforms are Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook (There are no accounts for mindfulness only the links)

## Typography <a name="typography"></a>

- The site uses the Roboto font.
It also uses Montserrat as a second font.
- The fonts were used as it is a popular font and fit well with the site.

## Individual page elements <a name="individual-page-elements"></a>

### Home: <a name="home"></a>

- This is the first view of the user and I wanted it to be short and sweet.
- The header is very simple and gives the user immediate access to the other pages.
- The section has two headings and two paragraphs
- It has an image of a Buddha meditating.

![Home](assets/gallery/site-home-page.png)

### Hero Section Content: <a name="hero-section"></a>

- This section shows a Buddha sitting peacefully in the forest near a river meditating with eyes closed.
- This also has a hidden button describing  the image for the visually impaired.

### Contact: <a name="contact"></a>

- This section has a form that allows the user to contact the site and provide questions.

## Testing Phase <a name="testing-phase"></a>

I have moved the details for the testing of the Paw's Play site to [Testing.md](../docs/TESTING.md)

## Deployment <a name="deployment"></a>

I deployed the site on GitHub using the following procedure:

1. Once on the project's repository, I clicked on the _settings_ tab.
2. Then select the _Pages_ tab.
3. Then under the _Source_ section, I selected the _Main_ branch from the dropdown menu and clicked _Save_.
4. After a few minutes, the page was deployed.
